# Introduction
The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model that would predict whether or not a call received by New York City 311 would be resolved on time. Incidents that are reported are given an estimate for how long they will take. 
# Dataset
The data was taken from the NYC Open Data website at this link: <br />
<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9> 
# Data Acquisition
The dataset was acquired: <br />

# Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned: <br /> https://github.com/jeffreyzhangma/Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb 

# Data Exploration
The dataset was explored: <br /> [Data Exploration](https://github.com/jeffreyzhangma/Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)

# Predictive Model
Finally a predictive model was built: <br />
