# Introduction
The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model that would predict whether or not a call received by New York City 311 would be resolved on time. Incidents that are reported are given an estimate for how long they will take. 
# Dataset
The data was taken from the NYC Open Data website at this link: <br />
