Springboard Capstone Project 2

The purpose of this project was to build a machine learning model that would predict whether or not a call received by New York City 311 would be resolved on time. Incidents that are reported are given an estimate for how long they will take. /n 
The data was taken from the NYC Open Data website at this link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9 
The dataset was acquired: /Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Data%20Acquisition.ipynb /n
The dataset was cleaned: https://github.com/jeffreyzhangma/Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb /n
The dataset was explored: https://github.com/jeffreyzhangma/Capstone-Project-2/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb /n
Finally a predictive model was built:
